#MY CA PROJECT
Write a program to implement  priority scheduling algorithm with context switching time. Prompt to user to enter the number of processes and then enter their priority, burst time and arrival time also. Now whenever operating system preempts a process and shifts cpu’s control to some another process of higher priority assume that it takes 2 seconds for context switching(dispatcher latency).Form a scenario, where we can give the processes are assigned with priority where the lower integer number is higher priority….. and thean context swith .. as the process waits the prioity of the process increase at rate of one per 2 time units of wait..

Calculate waiting time and turnaround time for each process
